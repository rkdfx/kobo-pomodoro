# Third-party licences

Cobalt is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License, version 3. It
links code and embeds fonts written by other people, all under permissive
licences or compatible GPL terms, so a binary built from this tree can be
redistributed under the AGPL as long as the notices below travel with it.

## Rust dependencies

| Selected licence | Crates |
| --- | --- |
| Apache-2.0 | dependencies that offer Apache-2.0 as an alternative, including `image`, `http`, `rustls`, `libc`, `png`, `flate2`, `ttf-parser`, and their transitive dependencies |
| MIT | `bytes`, `byteorder-lite`, `memchr`, `minimp3`, `minimp3-sys`, `pulldown-cmark`, `pulldown-cmark-escape`, `simd-adler32`, `slice-ring-buffer`, `vt100`, `zip` |
| Apache-2.0 and ISC | `ring` |
| ISC | `rustls-webpki`, `untrusted` |
| BSD-3-Clause | `subtle` |
| CDLA-Permissive-2.0 | `webpki-roots` |
| GPL-3.0-or-later | `shakmaty` |
| Zlib | `foldhash` |

Proc-macro and build-script crates (`unicode-ident` and its dependents, `cc`,
and similar) run at compile time only; no code from them ships in a binary, so
their terms do not attach to the distribution.

The release archive contains the complete selected terms and package-specific
notices in `licenses/LICENSE-Rust-dependencies.txt`. That includes `ring`'s
Apache-2.0 and ISC terms and the CDLA-Permissive-2.0 agreement for the Mozilla
CA data bundled by `webpki-roots`. The GPL-3.0-or-later terms selected for
`shakmaty` ship separately in `licenses/LICENSE-shakmaty.txt`.

## Comic archive dependency

The shared CBZ reader uses `zip` 4.6.1 (MIT), with default features disabled,
Stored and DEFLATE compression only, and `flate2`'s pure Rust backend. Its
resolved normal dependency closure is `crc32fast` 1.5.1, `cfg-if` 1.0.4,
`flate2` 1.1.10, `miniz_oxide` 0.9.1, `adler2` 2.0.1,
`simd-adler32` 0.3.10, `indexmap` 2.14.2, `equivalent` 1.0.2,
`hashbrown` 0.17.1 and `memchr` 2.8.3. Each offers MIT or Apache-2.0;
select Apache-2.0 when offered, otherwise MIT. ZIP's notice is included in
the Rust dependency notices above. No upstream archive fixtures are copied.
CBR is deferred; no RAR decoder is linked or invoked.

See [the shared comic decision](docs/quality/comic-reader-decision.md) for
resource limits, remaining release checks and the dependency assessment.

## Bundled content

| Application | Content | Terms |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `grimoire` | Excerpts from the System Reference Document 5.1 and 5.2 by Wizards of the Coast LLC | Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International; attribution is also included in the app |
| `pubquiz` | Starter questions sourced from Open Trivia DB | Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0; the app carries `QUESTION-DATA-LICENSE.md` |
| `verses` | Short poems by Emily Dickinson, William Blake and Percy Bysshe Shelley | Public domain; source and publication year are retained with each poem |

## Icons

The icon geometry every application draws comes from a published set rather
than being drawn here.

| Set | Licence | File |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tabler Icons 3.46.0 | MIT | `licenses/LICENSE-Tabler.txt` |

The artwork is converted once, offline, into checked-in Rust at
`crates/kobo-ui/src/vector/tabler.rs`, so nothing at build time or run time
reads an SVG or reaches the network. `scripts/import-icons.sh` reproduces that
file from the upstream tag, and `tools/icon-import/icons.txt` records which
icon stands behind which `Glyph`.

MIT imposes no copyleft, so this geometry travels inside an AGPL binary
without changing anything about it. What it does ask is that the notice
travels too, which is what the file above is for.

## Fonts

Two typefaces are embedded in the `kobo-text` crate and end up inside every
binary. Atkinson Hyperlegible is embedded in two weights, which the one licence
below covers. Flashcards additionally embeds the bounded Cobalt Japanese font
subset in its own host/device dependency closure. Their licences ship beside
the artifacts that contain them.

| Font | Licence | File |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Atkinson Hyperlegible (Regular and Bold) | SIL Open Font License 1.1 | `crates/kobo-text/fonts/LICENSE-AtkinsonHyperlegible.txt` |
| DejaVu Sans | Bitstream Vera and Arev fonts licence | `crates/kobo-text/fonts/LICENSE-DejaVu.txt` |
| Cobalt Japanese (derived Noto Sans CJK JP subset) | SIL Open Font License 1.1 | `licenses/LICENSE-Cobalt-Japanese-font.txt`; source and deterministic subset recipe in `licenses/SOURCE-Cobalt-Japanese-font.md` |

Both permit embedding and redistribution. The OFL forbids selling the font on
its own and requires the reserved name to be kept, which embedding does not
touch.

## Flashcards host conversion

The host-only converter is unofficial and is not affiliated with Ankitects,
Anki, or AnkiWeb. It uses no upstream logo or artwork. It links Anki rslib and
its i18n/proto support at one exact pinned revision. The Anki AGPL terms, resvg
source pin, exact revision, and host distribution requirements are in
[`licenses/NOTICE-Flashcards-Anki.md`](licenses/NOTICE-Flashcards-Anki.md).
Full Anki terms and corresponding-source instructions are in
`licenses/LICENSE-Anki.txt` and `licenses/SOURCE-Flashcards-Anki.md`.

The Kobo app consumes a Cobalt-owned neutral bundle and links no Anki code.
Consequently its package intentionally omits the Anki source/licence notice.
Resolved non-Anki dependency notices for the host helper and complete resolved
dependency notices for the device app are in
`licenses/LICENSE-Flashcards-host-dependencies.txt` and
`licenses/LICENSE-Flashcards-device-dependencies.txt`. The host's linked Anki
packages are noticed separately in the Anki notice/licence/source files. These
texts are embedded only in the corresponding artifacts; the app exposes its
device notices as paged text and the host helper prints its host notices with
`--licenses`.
Regenerate both deterministically with
`scripts/generate-flashcards-licenses.py`; its accepted SPDX policy is scoped
in `licenses/flashcards-about.toml`.

The device application links the FSRS review scheduler, which is vendored at
`third_party/fsrs` under BSD-3-Clause, and everything the scheduler itself
depends on. That subtree was absent from the generated notices: the policy
ignored packages marked `publish = false`, which is right for Cobalt's own
crates and wrong for vendored third-party source, and it took the scheduler's
dependencies out with it. The policy no longer ignores them.

`priority-queue`, which the scheduler uses, offers LGPL-3.0-or-later or
MPL-2.0. MPL-2.0 is the selected term: its obligations attach to the files it
covers, which a reader can satisfy from the source this project already
publishes, while LGPL-3.0 asks for relinking of a statically linked device
binary. LGPL-3.0 is therefore no longer an accepted term for this app, so the
choice cannot quietly revert the next time the notices are regenerated.

## Flashcards SVG rendering

The host Flashcards importer links `resvg`/`usvg` 0.45.1 to rasterize accepted
SVG image media before publication. The device application links the same
bounded path to verify due-card source/raster equality at admission, then
displays only the digest-addressed PNG. resvg is dual-licensed Apache-2.0 or
MIT; both selected terms travel in
[`licenses/LICENSE-resvg.txt`](licenses/LICENSE-resvg.txt).

## Services

The example applications talk to services this project does not own.

| Application | Service | Terms |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `hn` | Hacker News Firebase API | Public, unauthenticated, no key |
| `gutenbird` | Gutendex and Project Gutenberg | Public; Gutenberg texts are public domain in the US |
| `lichess` | Lichess Board and puzzle APIs | Official HTTPS origin; Board API access uses a runtime-held personal token |
| `rss` | Feedsearch | Public; the search screen carries the attribution its terms ask for |
| `calibre-web` | calibre-web or calibre content-server OPDS | Owner-supplied HTTPS service; optional HTTP Basic credential |
| `fanshelf` | Archive of Our Own public work pages | Public, unauthenticated lookups with an identifying user agent |
| `homepanel` | Home Assistant API | Owner-supplied HTTPS service using a runtime-held long-lived token |
| `kitchencard` | Mealie API | Owner-supplied service; Mealie is AGPL-3.0 |
| `lichess` | Lichess API | Public puzzle access; optional personal access token for account features |
| `needles` | Ravelry API | Account access through a runtime-held HTTP Basic credential |
| `panels` | Komga OPDS | Optional owner-supplied service; Komga is MIT licensed |
| `post` | Hermes gateway | Owner-supplied HTTPS gateway; Hermes Agent is MIT licensed |
| `pubquiz` | Open Trivia DB | Public question-pack API; returned question content is CC-BY-SA-4.0 |
| `readlater` | Wallabag API | Owner-supplied or hosted service; Wallabag is MIT licensed |
| `rss-miniflux` | Miniflux API | Owner-supplied or hosted service; Miniflux is Apache-2.0 licensed |

None of them is paid for or rate-limit-exempt. An application that hammers
them is your responsibility, not theirs.
